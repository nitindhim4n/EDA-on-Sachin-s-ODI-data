# Sachin Tendulkar ODI Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on a comprehensive analysis of Sachin Tendulkar's performance in One Day Internationals (ODIs). Leveraging Python and popular data analysis libraries, the project cleans, explores, and visualizes a dataset containing 463 ODI records. The analysis aims to uncover insights into Sachin's batting performance, centuries, match outcomes, and opposition-wise runs.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Utilized pandas to clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, removing irrelevant entries ('DNB' or 'TDNB'), and converting data types for accurate analysis.

- **Visualizations:** Employed matplotlib and seaborn to create visualizations, including box plots, scatter plots, bar graphs, and histograms. These visuals offer a detailed perspective on runs scored, yearly performance, opposition-wise runs, and centuries.

- **Statistical Insights:** Derived meaningful statistical insights, such as Sachin's performance in matches where he scored a century, match results, and opposition-wise centuries.
